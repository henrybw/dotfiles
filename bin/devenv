# Script that sets up a specific layout with gvim, a mini ranger browser, and a
# shell. This is designed around the gvim instance being used as a singleton;
# the ranger browser is also configured with this setup in mind. You can open
# files with the singleton gvim instance by using the 'gvim1' script.

# Make gvim have most of the screen

i3-msg exec gvim && sleep 0.2

# Add a ranger browser above the current shell

# Focus back on the original shell
