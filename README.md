My configuration files for general-purpose use, i.e. personal machines like
desktops, laptops, etc.

This repo is considerably heavyweight, and contains stuff like config files for
i3 and KDE Konsole. I also maintain a more lightweight fork,
[dotfiles-min](https://bitbucket.org/hbw/dotfiles-min), for stuff like shell
accounts on servers.
